    <h2>About Ericka</h2>
    
    <p>I graduated from the University of Houston-Downtown with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing.  A few years later, I graduated from the University of Dallas with an MBA in Finance.  I took a break from the workforce to raise my three children.  Once they were in school, I returned to the workforce and continued my career as a financial advisor.</p>
    
    <div class="gap-sm"></div>

    <p>The pandemic caused the world to slow down and forced me to work from home.  I found myself with spare time.  Thus, the challenge of learning to code on my own started.  I quickly realized I needed structure in my leanring. Therefore I looked to Thinkful to help me sharpen my current skills and to learn new programming languages.  I will add that my journey has not been easy; however, I am passionate about being the best software developer I can be!</p>
    
    <div class="gap-sm"></div>

    <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer, please reach out!  I am excited to start my career as a software developer!</p>
